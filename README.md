# Pharamacy Database Project

Created a example database for a Pharmacy and a usable interface for the Employees, so they can easily manipulate the data.

From the site, the Employees can:

-Add, modify or delete customers.

-Issue prescription drugs

-Print reports for the health fund

-Print different reports based on the selected time period for the report

-Change stock when an item is sold.

-Calculate the commission for each sale.

Used MySQL Database and Apache Web Server (XAMPP).

In the project itself, there are several salespeople,but the licensed pharmacists are only part of them. Only licensed pharmacists are allowed to dispense prescription drugs. Each prescription contains only one medicine.All drugs in prescriptions are paid for by the health fund.The others are paid in cash. For each sale is responsible a seller, who receives a commission at the end of the month.
Each drug or sanitary material is identified by a code, name, producer, suppliers and of course â€“ price. Each medicine can replace and be replaced by another medicine.Each customer (with prescriptions) has his code, name, personal number and address.

There is an export of the database so it can easily be imported and see the functionality of the site.
Also there is a entity relationship diagram created using https://draw.io/
